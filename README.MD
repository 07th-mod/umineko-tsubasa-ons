# Umineko Tsubasa English PS3 patch

This is an attempt to merge the English translation
of Umineko Tsubasa together with the [PS3 mod by Golden Abyss](http://golden-abyss.blogspot.com/2015/12/umineko-tsubasa-ps3_19.html)
which is available exclusively in the Russian language.

This mod *does not* add voices, since Tsubasa has never actually been released by Alchemist, and therefore not voiced.
This mod *does* add ADV mode.

Installation instructions:

- Go to the [releases page](../../releases).
- Download the latest version of the mod.
- Extract the archive to the Umineko Tsubasa directory (you need to own the Japanese game to use this!). Note: you *do* want to keep the subfolder, in other words, after extraction, your game should now contain a `[07th-Mod]` folder.
- Run `[07th-Mod] Umineko Tsubasa.exe` inside the `[07th-Mod]` folder and enjoy the currently-translated stories.

The main point of interest for developers is `0.txt`, the main script file which is used by this mod. 
***IMPORTANT***: this file is encoded in Shift-JIS, and must remain in this encoding!
